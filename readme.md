# Supernote in a canvas

Display your notes in a canvas, so you can manipulate the pages in new ways

![img.png](img.png)

You can try this [online](https://cristianvasquez.github.io/supernote-tldraw/
)

To use, drag and drop a .note file into the canvas

All transformations occur directly in your browser (your notes remain private and are not transmitted to any server)

Note: this is a tldraw canvas with limited functionality. So I recommend to
use [this app](https://cristianvasquez.github.io/supernote-tldraw/
) just to extract the pages from a .note file, then open a new tab with [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw). 

Then,
simply copy and paste your pages into tldraw. In that way you can save your work, upload other media and even
collaborate with others.

To just display a .note file, you can also try a simpler variant at [supernote-web-viewer/](https://cristianvasquez.github.io/supernote-web-viewer/)

### Thanks to

The canvas functionality is provided by [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) and the supernote transformation
uses [supernote-typescript](https://github.com/philips/supernote-typescript)
