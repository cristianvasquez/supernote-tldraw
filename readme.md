# Documents in a canvas

Display your pdfs and supernote notes in a canvas, so you can manipulate the pages in new ways

![img.png](img.png)

You can try this [online](https://cristianvasquez.github.io/supernote-tldraw/
)

To use, drag and drop a document into the canvas

Supported files:

- pdfs
- .note files (supernote)

All transformations occur directly in your browser (your documents remain private and are not transmitted to any server)

Note: this is a tldraw canvas with limited functionality. So I recommend to
use this just to extract the pages from a .note or pdf file.

Open a new tab with [tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw), then, simply copy and paste your pages into tldraw. In
that way you can save your work, upload other media and even collaborate with others.

### Supernote files

Alternatively, to just display a .note file, you can also try a simpler variant
at [supernote-web-viewer/](https://cristianvasquez.github.io/supernote-web-viewer/)
