Display your notes in a canvas, so you can manipulate the pages in other ways

You can try this [online](https://cristianvasquez.github.io/supernote-tldraw/
)

To use, drag and drop a .note file into the canvas

All transformations occur directly in your browser (your notes remain private and are not transmitted to any server)
